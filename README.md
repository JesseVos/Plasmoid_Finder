# Plasmoid_Finder
A plasmoid identification algorithm, or rather a `blob' identifcation algorithm, that is able to detect elliptical structure in any provided map. The algorithm will be made availabe after a clean-up and potential upgrade. If you would like access before that time, please contact jt [dot] vos [at] astro [dot] ru [dot] nl .
